This was the final mandatory project for the course "Programmeringsteknik 2", spring semester 2016, my second programming course.

My implementation passed; the code remains unchanged since the examination, so, while it works to a satisfying degree the code might be somewhat poorly structured.

See "uppgift.pdf" for project specification.
