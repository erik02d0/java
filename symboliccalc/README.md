# Symbolic Calculator

This was the final mandatory project for the course "Programmeringsteknik 2", spring semester 2016, my second programming course.

The code doesn't work, in that some expressions are incorrect. Since I passed the course everything was in order at some point, but apparently I must have corrupted the files since.

See "uppgift.pdf" for project specification. To run, do:

`javac Calculator.java`

`java Calculator`

You can now try various expressions, or use the examination test file:

`file test.txt`
