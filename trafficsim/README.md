# Traffic Simulation

This was a mandatory project for the course "Programmeringsteknik 1", spring semester 2016, my first programming course.

My implementation passed; the code remains unchanged since the examination, so, while it works to a satisfying degree the code might be somewhat poorly structured.

See "trafiksimulering.pdf" for project specification. To run, do:

`$javac Simulation.java`

`$java Simulation`
